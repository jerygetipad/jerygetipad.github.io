So here we are. I created this website entirely in Quarto using RStudio. I plan on showcasing any future work here.\nFitness – Reporting, Automation, and Data Viz\nIn May 2023, I started a fitness program with a trainer. With my weightlifting data, I created some reports with R that show my progress over time. You can read about my journey here.\nStat Graphics - Data Viz\nBG 2020 – coming soon\nMath Modeling - Zombie Disease Model\nUC 2018 – coming soon\nPhysically Accurate Golf - 2017 - Physics Modelling - Research\nOne of my first projects at the University of Cincinnati was to model the flight of a golf ball. This was a great exercise in product development and building on the research of others to create something of our own. Working with three others to complete this project, we later incorporated our final model into the video game below.\nClick here to play!"
