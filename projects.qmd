I've spent a lot of time developing my skills in mathematics and data science. I consider the projects below to be complete and representative of my career arc.

1.  Website -- Quarto, R Markdown

    I do not enjoy web programming. but I've been told self-promotion is important. So here we are. I created this website entirely in Quarto using RStudio. I plan on showcasing any future work here.

2.  Fitness -- Reporting, Automation, and Data Viz

    In May 2023, I started a fitness program with a trainer. With my weightlifting data, I created some reports with R that show my progress over time. You can read about my journey [here](fitness.qmd).

3.  Stat Graphics - Data Viz

    BG 2020 -- coming soon

4.  Math Modeling - Zombie Disease Model

    UC 2018 -- coming soon

5.  Physically Accurate Golf - 2017 - Physics Modelling - Research

    One of my first projects at the University of Cincinnati was to model the flight of a golf ball. This was a great exercise in product development and building on the research of others to create something of our own. Working with three others to complete this project, we later incorporated our final model into the video game below.
